N﻿eed to setup ruby first:

1. Don't use the Mac system Ruby (2.6.10)
> which ruby which gem
2. Need ruby version manager like NVM or py
>﻿ rvm vs rbenv vs asdf vs frum https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/   unlike nvm or pyenv, there seems to be multiple choices

3. ASDF supports multiple lang, rbenv uses shim slower but most popular, chruby is fastest use chruby-exec. Usually I go for rbenv as it has most support, but I want to try out asdf as it works for other lang as well

#### brew install asdf
brew info asdf
- e.g. ~/.profile or ~/.zshrc: 
  . /usr/local/opt/asdf/libexec/asdf.sh

asdf plugin add ruby
- _﻿/Users/lge11/.asdf/repository_

>need proxy ssh: connect to host github.com port 22: Operation timed out
`fatal: Could not read from remote repository.`

>p﻿roxy already setup asdf not using
- `﻿
export HTTP_PROXY="un:pw@proxy.aexp.com:8080"
export HTTPS_PROXY="un:pw@proxy.aexp.com:8080"
echo $HTTPS_PROXY
echo $HTTP_PROXY`

>c﻿reate ~/.curlrc file 
proxy = <proxy_host>:<proxy_port>

>i﻿ssue is with git ssh
- ssh -T git@github.com  also times out 

>nano ~/.ssh/config

- `﻿
Host github.com
 Hostname ssh.github.com
 Port 443
`﻿
t﻿he firewall is blocking some ports https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15589682
_﻿git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://_ 
d﻿idn't work 

asdf list all ruby

asdf install ruby latest
- ﻿Installed ruby-3.3.5 to /Users/lge11/.asdf/installs/ruby/3.3.5


asdf global ruby 3.3.5
-﻿ set the ~/.tool-versions file 

ruby -v

asdf list ruby
asdf local ruby 2.7.3
asdf uninstall ruby 2.7.3

which ruby 
_﻿/usr/bin/ruby_

#### debug asdf install 
https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf/issues/1792

-﻿ brew install asdf 
>﻿echo -e "\n. $(brew --prefix asdf)/asdf.sh" >> ~/.zshrc

>﻿this adds `. /usr/local/opt/asdf/libexec/asdf.sh` to .zshrc file
>﻿ the issue is the path is still   echo $PATH
`/usr/local/bin:/System/Cryptexes/App/usr/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/var/run/com.apple.security.cryptexd/codex.system/bootstrap/usr/local/bin:/var/run/com.apple.security.cryptexd/codex.system/bootstrap/usr/bin:/var/run/com.apple.security.cryptexd/codex.system/bootstrap/usr/appleinternal/bin:/Library/Apple/usr/bin`

s﻿him is not installed before /usr/bin, asdf is added to path but need to source the asdf.sh, that command is not found in tutorial, and echo returns the symbolink only 
>﻿ echo -e "\n. $(brew --prefix asdf)/asdf.sh"
`﻿. /usr/local/opt/asdf/asdf.sh`

>source /usr/local/opt/asdf/asdf.sh
source: no such file or directory: /usr/local/opt/asdf/asdf.sh

>type -a ruby                              
ruby is /Users/lge11/.asdf/shims/ruby
ruby is /usr/bin/ruby

>﻿ which asdf          
/usr/local/bin/asdf
