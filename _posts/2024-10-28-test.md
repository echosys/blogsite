I helped clarify the core goals of the Enterprise Data Governance (EDG) strategy by working alongside team members to understand its main components and ensure they aligned with broader business objectives. I contributed to the development of a POA (Plan of Action) business reference architecture, supporting efforts to promote this architecture among teams and enhance collective understanding. I also gained insight into detailed architectures tailored to specific risk types, which has deepened my understanding of how our organization addresses and manages risk with accuracy and precision.

I focused on fostering an inclusive and growth-oriented environment by designing a strategic plan to support new team members. This plan included knowledge-sharing sessions on capture subsystems and hands-on guidance for capture command codes in our payment orchestration workflow. I also worked closely with new hires on integration testing and provided mentorship on various tasks, such as creating capture tables and presenting changes to the CAB (Change Advisory Board) for release approvals. These efforts encouraged proactive learning, strengthened team collaboration, and ensured new colleagues felt supported in their professional development.

I actively collaborated with Business and Product teams to deliver high-priority features on time and within budget, ensuring our work aligned with enterprise goals. Specifically, I enhanced the capture workflow with critical functions like duplicate checks and data retrieval to streamline refund processes, directly impacting user experience. I promoted best practices by creating flow diagrams for code review, which improved adherence to coding standards across the team. Additionally, I adopted certified foundational frameworks by implementing GitHub Actions for improved pipeline efficiency, which supported transparency in our delivery progress. My work on debugging and optimizing database processes also helped establish a technical advantage, allowing us to deliver in a way that supports our competitive edge in the market.

I contributed to sustainable financial management and increased efficiency by leveraging the CSU self-onboarding API for my bill pay project, which simplified testing with self-service profiles. To improve automation, I collaborated with the environment support team to resolve token generation issues, optimizing deployment for nginx through automated Ansible deployment. This ensured a smoother, more cost-effective rollout process. Additionally, I worked on design optimization by aligning required changes across IDaaS, nginx, and web proxy configurations, simplifying our technical environment for the onboarding of new initiators. By streamlining the process, I made reviews more efficient, reducing operational costs and complexity, and supporting our financial goals.

I strengthened platform availability and resilience by leading several key initiatives, including enhancements to the capture orchestration workflow. This involved critical updates, database changes, and extensive testing to ensure stability across customer journeys. I proactively conducted failover tests in both local and E1 environments, helping to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they could impact production. I contributed to platform health campaigns by performing PET E1 testing, identifying gaps in TLS configurations, and collaborating with the Shield team on production support to address cyber risks. Additionally, I refined JSON data structures to improve tracking metrics and support cybersecurity goals. These efforts helped close audit findings on time, improved cyber metrics, and reduced tech debt, ensuring our platforms are secure and resilient for both customers and colleagues.

/﻿/

Set the Agenda: I defined what success looked like for my team by establishing a clear strategy for capturing workflow enhancements and testing protocols, ensuring alignment with enterprise objectives. By “putting enterprise thinking first,” I prioritized initiatives like the capture dupcheck and refund workflow improvements, which directly benefit our platform’s stability and customer experience. I also incorporated an “external perspective” by staying informed on industry standards in automation and data management, leveraging these insights to introduce GitHub Actions for more efficient pipeline management.

Bring Others With You: I fostered inclusivity and growth by actively mentoring new hires, pairing with them on hands-on tasks like integration testing, capture table creation, and change advisory presentations. I encouraged open dialogue and provided constructive feedback, empowering team members to grow their skills. To “make collaboration essential,” I partnered closely with the environment support and product teams, ensuring each project had input from various stakeholders, which helped us deliver features on time and within budget.

Do It the Right Way: I prioritized transparent and clear communication by organizing transition sessions that addressed complex topics, like capture workflow and payment event trigger APIs, to streamline knowledge sharing. I made timely and effective decisions, especially when resolving deployment issues that affected automation, by quickly identifying the root causes and collaborating with the right teams. Upholding “Blue Box Values,” I demonstrated authenticity and courage by addressing cybersecurity and resilience challenges proactively, ensuring our systems remained robust and aligned with company values.

This year, I learned the importance of adaptability and proactive collaboration. Working across different projects and teams, I saw firsthand how quickly technology and business priorities can evolve, requiring us to stay agile and forward-thinking. One major learning was the value of integrating structured knowledge-sharing sessions to onboard and support new colleagues effectively, which not only builds team cohesion but also accelerates productivity. I also gained insights into balancing technical rigor with speed, particularly in adopting automation and simplifying complex processes to meet financial and operational goals without compromising quality. Finally, I deepened my understanding of cybersecurity and platform resilience by actively participating in failover testing and platform health initiatives. This experience taught me that elevating our risk posture and maintaining system integrity requires continuous effort and collaboration across departments.

I took several steps to advance our EDM strategy by actively discovering and assessing the existing POD enterprise data governance platforms and applications, which allowed me to identify gaps that may hinder seamless data governance. I defined the core goals of the Enterprise Data Governance (EDG) strategy, breaking down its main components to ensure clarity and alignment with broader business objectives. Additionally, I contributed to the creation of a POA (Plan of Action) business reference architecture, which I promoted among teams to ensure widespread understanding and adoption. I also developed detailed architectures tailored to each specific risk type, enhancing our ability to address and manage risk with precision. In the realm of technology innovation, I explored generative AI tools to determine how they might be leveraged to automate data catalog extraction directly from source code, an initiative that could significantly improve data cataloging efficiency and accuracy.

/﻿/

This year, I completed over five training sessions focused on advancing my skills in generative AI (Gen AI), particularly in setting up and running the Llama model locally. This training equipped me with foundational knowledge in AI model deployment, which is essential for our exploration of Gen AI applications within Enterprise Data Management (EDM). Key beginner Gen AI topics covered included understanding model architecture, managing data preprocessing, and the importance of ethical considerations in AI deployment. I learned how to optimize model performance on local hardware, handle prompt engineering effectively, and manage resources to support smooth model operations.

This Gen AI training has directly benefited my work by allowing me to contribute to our EDM strategy with insights on how AI can be used to automate data cataloging and improve policy encoding processes. These skills also support future initiatives where we may leverage Gen AI tools to streamline data governance, making our data catalog extraction from source code more efficient and enhancing the accuracy of metadata integration. By deepening my understanding of both technical setup and practical applications, I’m well-positioned to drive innovation and support Gen AI initiatives in alignment with our strategic goals.
